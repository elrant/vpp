# Vanilla++

Team Elrant's Vanilla++ is a kitchen-sink(ish) modpack focused on keeping a Vanilla feel.

Key Features:

- Based on [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized/)
- Overhauled Combat and Overworld worldgen
- Just as fast (and often even FASTER) than Vanilla!
- Better villages and villagers!
- Several building blocks, tweaks and more!
